# Different Architecture Types

## Software Architecture Patterns

### Monolithic Architecture
A single deployable unit containing all application components. Simple to develop and deploy initially, but becomes complex as the application grows. All components share the same database and runtime environment.

### Microservices Architecture
Application split into small, independent services that communicate via APIs. Each service has its own database and can be deployed independently. Offers scalability and technology diversity but increases operational complexity.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Services communicate through well-defined interfaces and protocols. More heavyweight than microservices, typically uses enterprise service buses. Focuses on reusability and loose coupling between services.

### Layered Architecture
Organized into horizontal layers (presentation, business, data access). Each layer only communicates with adjacent layers. Promotes separation of concerns but can create performance bottlenecks.

### Event-Driven Architecture
Components communicate through events rather than direct calls. Promotes loose coupling and real-time processing. Common in systems requiring high scalability and asynchronous processing.

### Serverless Architecture
Code runs in stateless compute containers managed by cloud providers. Automatically scales based on demand. Ideal for event-driven applications but has vendor lock-in concerns.

## System Architecture Types

### Client-Server Architecture
Clients request services from centralized servers. Clear separation of concerns but server can become a bottleneck. Traditional web applications follow this pattern.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
All nodes act as both clients and servers. No central authority, highly distributed. Common in file-sharing systems and blockchain networks.

### Distributed Architecture
System components are located on different networked computers. Provides fault tolerance and scalability but introduces network latency and complexity.

## Key Differences

**Coupling**: Monolithic (tight) vs Microservices (loose) vs SOA (moderate)
**Scalability**: Serverless and microservices excel, monolithic struggles
**Complexity**: Monolithic (simple) vs Distributed systems (complex)
**Performance**: Monolithic (fast internal calls) vs Distributed (network overhead)
**Deployment**: Monolithic (single unit) vs Microservices (independent services)

## Choosing the Right Architecture

Consider factors like team size, scalability requirements, performance needs, and operational capabilities. Start simple with monolithic for small projects, evolve to microservices as complexity grows. Event-driven suits real-time systems, while serverless works well for variable workloads.

Each architecture type serves different needs - there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The key is understanding your requirements and constraints to make an informed choice.
