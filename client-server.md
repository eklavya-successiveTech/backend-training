# Client-Server Architecture

## Overview
Client-server architecture is a distributed computing model where client applications request services and resources from centralized server systems. The client initiates communication, while the server responds to requests and provides services.

## Core Components

### Client
- **Definition**: The requesting entity that initiates communication
- **Responsibilities**: User interface, input validation, data presentation
- **Examples**: Web browsers, mobile apps, desktop applications
- **Characteristics**: Typically lightweight, handles user interaction

### Server
- **Definition**: The service provider that responds to client requests
- **Responsibilities**: Business logic, data processing, resource management
- **Examples**: Web servers, database servers, application servers
- **Characteristics**: Powerful hardware, handles multiple concurrent clients

## Communication Model

### Request-Response Pattern
1. Client sends a request to the server
2. Server processes the request
3. Server sends a response back to the client
4. Client processes the response and updates the user interface

### Protocols
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web applications and REST APIs
- **TCP/UDP**: General network communication
- **FTP**: File transfer
- **SMTP**: Email services

## Types of Client-Server Architecture

### Two-Tier Architecture
- **Thin Client**: Client handles presentation, server handles business logic and data
- **Thick Client**: Client handles presentation and business logic, server manages data
- **Fat Client**: Client handles most processing, server primarily stores data

### Three-Tier Architecture
- **Presentation Tier**: User interface (client)
- **Application Tier**: Business logic (application server)
- **Data Tier**: Database management (database server)

### N-Tier Architecture
Multiple layers with specialized servers for different functions (web servers, application servers, database servers, caching servers).

## Advantages
- **Centralized Management**: Easier to maintain, update, and secure
- **Resource Sharing**: Multiple clients can access shared resources
- **Scalability**: Can add more servers to handle increased load
- **Security**: Centralized security policies and data protection
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for data and business rules

## Disadvantages
- **Single Point of Failure**: Server downtime affects all clients
- **Network Dependency**: Requires reliable network connectivity
- **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Server can become overwhelmed with requests
- **Higher Infrastructure Costs**: Requires powerful server hardware
- **Latency**: Network communication introduces delays

## Real-World Examples
- **Web Applications**: Browser (client) communicating with web server
- **Email Systems**: Email client connecting to mail server
- **Online Banking**: Mobile app accessing bank's server systems
- **Gaming**: Game client connecting to game servers
- **Database Applications**: Applications querying database servers

## Best Practices
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use load balancing to distribute client requests
- Design for fault tolerance with backup servers
- Optimize network communication to reduce latency
- Implement caching strategies to improve performance
- Monitor server performance and client usage patterns

Client-server architecture remains fundamental to modern computing, providing a reliable foundation for distributed applications while balancing centralized control with distributed access.
