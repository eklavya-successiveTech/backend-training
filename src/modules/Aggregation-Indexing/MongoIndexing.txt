Part 2: Indexing
Tasks
1. Check indexes on the collection.
2. Create an index on customerName. Run a query filtering by customerName and
check performance using explain("executionStats").
3. Create a compound index on status and orderDate. Run a query filtering by both
and compare performance (before vs after).
4. Create a text index on items.productName. Perform a text search for a product.
5. Drop an index and observe performance difference.
Hint: Explore db.orders.getIndexes(), db.orders.createIndex(),
db.orders.dropIndex(), and
db.orders.find(...).explain("executionStats").
Deliverable: Document query execution times before and after ind
