# Validation

Validation is the process of verifying that data meets the required criteria before it is processed or stored. In software applications, especially web applications, input validation is a critical security measure that helps prevent malicious data from compromising system integrity.

## Why are validations important? 

Prevent Injection Attacks
Ensure Data Integrity
Mitigate Authentication and Authorization Bypass
Reduce Application Errors
Compliance with Security Standards

## Types of Validations 

1. Client side validation : Provides immediate feedback and reduces server load. Should never be solely relied upon for security because it can be bypassed.
2. Server-side Validation : Essential for security since client-side validation can be circumvented.

## Security vulnerabilities 
Injection attacks 
Cross-site scripting(xss)
Buffer overflows 
Authentication bypass
